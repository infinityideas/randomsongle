## How to make a copy
This project is licensed under GNU's Lesser General Public License. This means that you are free to copy, modify, and distribute the code (with some limitations; check out the license file for more).

**Note:** This program uses animations from the GSAP library (GreenSock, Inc). Some of these animations require a valid BusinessGreen license to use (SVG animations, etc). You are free to buy your own license and paste in your token into a .npmrc file. Certain animations, including the green progress bar in the music player, uses one of these animations and the program **will not work** unless you have the appropriate license.
